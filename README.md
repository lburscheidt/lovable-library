# Lovable Library

A small but mighty library app, created as part of The Odin Project's JavaScript
course.The app allows you to keep track of books you have. You can add books
with their title, author, number of pages, and whether you've read them or not.
When you finish one, you can easily mark it as read with just a click of a
button.
